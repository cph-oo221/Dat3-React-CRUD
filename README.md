## Description

Todo . . . .

## Requirements

The project has to contain the following:

- A `README.md` file with a description of the project.
- A `package.json` file with all the dependencies.
- A `http` file with all the CRUD method calls.
- Use React hooks like `useState`, `useEffect` etc.
- Use the `fetch` API to communicate with the server.
- Use the `json-server` to persist data.
- All four CRUD operations should be implemented.
- All CRUD functions should be separated into a separate file.

Do a short video presentation of your project where you show your user interface, explain how it works and guide us through your code. Both your link to the video and code should be emailed to your group-teacher.
